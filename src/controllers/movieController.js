The ship is on its way back to Earth, carrying a load of extraterrestrial ore, when its crew is awakened from hypersleep, a type of high-tech hibernation, by the shipâ€™s computer, Mother. The ship has intercepted what appears to be a distress signal from an uncharted planetoid, LV-426. Obligated to respond, the crew lands on the planetoid, and several of its members explore the surface. They find a spacecraft with a dead pilot and a cargo of alien eggs. When crew member Kane (John Hurt) inspects an egg that has opened, he is attacked by a face-hugging creature that inserts part of its body down his throat and clings fiercely to his head.',

She is rescued and debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, who are skeptical about her claim of alien eggs in a derelict ship on the exomoon LV-426, since it is now the site of a terraforming colony.\n\nAfter contact is lost with the colony, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany them to investigate. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures. Ripley is introduced to the Colonial Marines on the spaceship Sulaco but is distrustful of their android, Bishop, because the android aboard the Nostromo betrayed its crew to protect the alien on company orders.',

While the promotion ceremony is taking place, Captain Jack Sparrow, who initially arrived in Port Royal to "commandeer" a ship, runs into two Royal Navy guards, Murtogg and Mullroy, who reveal to Jack that the HMS Interceptor is the fastest ship in the Caribbean.\n\nAfter the ceremony is finished, Commodore Norrington proposes to Elizabeth, before her corset makes her faint and fall into the water below, causing the medallion to emit a pulse. Jack rescues Elizabeth before escaping Commodore Norrington, who identifies Jack with his pirate brand. Will, now a blacksmith, meets Jack and fights long enough for Sparrow to be imprisoned.',
